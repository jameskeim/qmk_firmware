# The Tardis Layout

Only been playing with the Planck for a couple weeks but my first impression
was similar to the experience that people have when they first enter the
Tardis on _Doctor Who_. You know, how they step in, step back out and look at 
how small it is, and then step back inside and say, "But how?"

That's been my experience with the Planck. It seems much bigger on the inside
than it seems on the outside.

## Qwerty Writer's Layout

Yes, I'm using the singular possessive there and it's not intended to be a 
universal singular. Really, I'm trying to say two things:

 - This is not a programmer's layout. So, I've left the symbols mostly in the
   default positions -- with a couple of exceptions. I also left [RETURN] in
   the standard position. I'm not using it as much, preferring [RETURN] and
   [BACKSPACE] on the raise and lower keys.
 - I've dropped the QWERTY, DVORAK, and PLOVER layouts. This might be   
   temporary. I don't use the other layouts and they made navigating my keymap
   file more cumbersome. But, if there is room, I'll re-include them so that
   this really does become a Tardis layout.

## The Layers

 - *_QWERTY* -- A mostly standard QWERTY layer. I'll explain some of my choices
   later. 
 - *_LOWER* -- Pretty sure this is mostly standard too.
 - *_RAISE* -- 
 - *_SPACEFN* --
 - *_GR* --
 - *_GR_S* --
 - *_QUOTFN* --
 - *_MAUS* --
 - *_ADJUST* --
